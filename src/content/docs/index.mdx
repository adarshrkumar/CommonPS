## What is Common Pseudocode?

Common Pseudocode is a friendly pseudocode language designed to make learning programming concepts easy and intuitive. It combines familiar syntax from popular languages with natural language readability.

  <Card title="Easy to Learn" icon="open-book">
    Works like JavaScript with Python-style indentation. Multiple syntax styles supported for the same operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Natural Language" icon="pencil">
    Write `if age is greater than 18` or `if age > 18` - both work!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rich Features" icon="puzzle">
    Supports functions, arrays, records, loops, and all essential programming constructs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="VSCode Extension" icon="vscode">
    Syntax highlighting available through our [VSCode extension](https://github.com/adarshrkumar/pscode-syntax-highlighter).

## Quick Example

```pscode
// Calculate factorial
function factorial takes in n
    if n is less than or equal to 1
        return 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

result = factorial(5)
output "Factorial of 5 is: " result
```

## Language Highlights

- **Flexible Syntax**: Use natural language or traditional operators
- **Type Support**: Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and records
- **Control Flow**: if/else, switch, for, while, do-while, repeat-until loops
- **Built-in Functions**: Math, string manipulation, array operations
- **Comments**: Single-line `//` and multi-line `/* */` comments
- **No Semicolons**: Each line is treated as a statement automatically
