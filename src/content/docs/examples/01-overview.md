description: Collection of practical examples and common algorithms in Common Pseudocode
---

This section contains practical examples and implementations of common algorithms in Common Pseudocode. These examples demonstrate best practices and show how to combine different language features to solve real problems.

## Example Categories

### Search Algorithms

- **[Linear Search](/examples/linear-search)** - Sequential search through an array
- **[Binary Search](/examples/binary-search)** - Efficient search in sorted arrays

### Sorting Algorithms

- **[Bubble Sort](/examples/bubble-sort)** - Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm

### Array Operations

- **[Find Maximum](/examples/find-maximum)** - Finding the largest value in an array
- **[Array Statistics](/examples/array-statistics)** - Calculate sum, average, min, and max

### Practical Applications

- **[Input Validation](/examples/input-validation)** - Validating and processing user input
- **[Menu System](/examples/menu-system)** - Creating interactive menu-driven programs

## Learning Path

If you're new to Common Pseudocode, we recommend exploring the examples in this order:

1. **Start with Array Operations** - Learn basic array manipulation
2. **Move to Search Algorithms** - Understand how to find elements
3. **Try Sorting Algorithms** - Learn to organize data
4. **Build Practical Applications** - Apply concepts to real problems

## Using These Examples

Each example includes:

- **Full code implementation** - Complete, working pseudocode
- **Explanation** - How the algorithm works
- **Time/Space Complexity** - Performance characteristics (where applicable)
- **Usage examples** - How to call and use the function
- **Variations** - Alternative approaches or improvements

Feel free to copy, modify, and experiment with these examples to learn Common Pseudocode!
